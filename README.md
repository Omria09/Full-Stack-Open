# Full Stack Open Course Repository

This repository contains my work and progress for the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course by the University of Helsinki.

## About the Course

The Full Stack Open course covers modern web development, focusing on JavaScript-based technologies such as React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The course takes a hands-on approach with assignments and projects to reinforce the concepts covered in each section.

## Technologies

Throughout the course, I will be using the following technologies:
- **Frontend:** React, Redux
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Databases:** MongoDB
- **Others:** GraphQL, TypeScript, Testing with Jest, CI/CD

## Repository Structure

Each part of the course has a corresponding folder in the repository. Here’s the structure:

```
├── part0
├── part1
├── part2
├── part3
├── part4
├── part5
├── part6
├── part7
├── part8
├── part9
├── part10
├── part11
├── part12
└── part13
```

Each folder contains the assignments and projects for that particular part.

## Assignments

The assignments aim to deepen understanding and apply concepts from each section. Solutions are implemented according to the instructions and requirements for each exercise.

## Projects

The course includes larger projects that integrate multiple technologies and concepts. Projects are available in separate folders under the relevant part they belong to.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Omria09/Full-Stack-Open.git
   cd Full-Stack-Open
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder for the part or assignment you’d like to run.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
